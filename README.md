LSoC
====

**LSoC** is the repository for the **Libre Semester of Code**, an
[IRILL](http://www.irill.org)-sponsored initiative.

Mission statement: *training tomorrow's engineers by contributing to
today's free software*.

This repository collects the documents related to the day-to-day
operations of the LSoC. It also hosts a LSoC wiki, composed of two
main sections:
- the LSoC guidelines, supported by a set of *good practices*;
- a portal to collect internship proposals submitted by free and
  open-source software projects.

Please use the
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) syntax
to edit the wiki and portal.
