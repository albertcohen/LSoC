LSoC
====

**LSoC** is the repository for the **Libre Semester of Code**, an
[IRILL](http://www.irill.org)-sponsored initiative. The LSoC mission
statement is *training tomorrow's engineers by contributing to today's
free software*.

The repository has two main sections:
- the LSoC rules, supported by a *good practices* wiki;
- a portal to collect internship proposals submitted by FOSS projects.

Please use the Markdown syntax to edit the wiki and portal.
